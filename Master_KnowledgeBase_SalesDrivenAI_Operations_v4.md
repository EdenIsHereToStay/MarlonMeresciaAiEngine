    - **Smart Segmentation & Lead Scoring**: AI agents analyze and qualify leads, segmenting them based on predefined criteria to improve targeting.
    - **Omnichannel Outreach**: AI agents automate outreach across multiple platforms (WhatsApp, SMS, email), providing dynamic and personalized interaction.
    - **Instant Engagement & Follow-Up**: Reducing the "speed to lead" to under 10 seconds and ensuring timely follow-up with booking links, support, and next steps.
    - **Data-Driven Personalization**: AI tracks interactions and adapts responses based on lead behavior for personalized engagement.
    - **Automation in Lead Qualification**: AI systems evaluate lead quality and send relevant booking or product links, reducing manual intervention.

  - **Steps**:

    - **Integrate AI Agents**:
      - Use GoHighLevel to connect custom-built AI agents to your CRM system.
      - Train the AI agents on your business offerings, qualification criteria, and next steps within the funnel (e.g., booking pages, product links).

    Example GPT prompt:

    ```
    "Create an AI agent for lead qualification that follows up with unbooked leads within 10 minutes using WhatsApp or SMS."
    ```

    - **Automate Lead Follow-Up**:
      - Set up automation rules for leads that don’t book a call within one hour of submitting their information.
      - Program AI agents to send follow-up messages with booking links or service information via WhatsApp or SMS.

    Example automation flow:

    - **Trigger**: Lead submits form.
    - **Action**: AI agent sends a WhatsApp or SMS with a booking link.
    - **If booked**: AI confirms the appointment.
    - **If not booked**: AI sends reminders and educational content within 24 hours.

    - **Smart Segmentation & Lead Scoring**:

      - Establish lead scoring rules based on specific criteria (e.g., budget, company size).
      - Use GoHighLevel’s pipeline management to segment leads according to their score and automatically tag them.

      Example scoring criteria:

      - **Hot Lead (7-10)**: Revenue over $100K, decision-making authority.
      - **Warm Lead (4-6)**: Relevant but with smaller potential.
      - **Cold Lead (1-3)**: Not an immediate fit.

    - **Personalized Engagement**:
      - Set up AI to engage with leads before scheduled calls through messages, voice notes, or videos.
      - Automate reminders and reduce no-show rates by offering value through custom content.

    Example prompt for WhatsApp bot:

    ```
    "Send the client a video about our AI solutions 48 hours before the scheduled call."
    ```

    - **Monthly Follow-Up Campaigns**:
      - Implement AI-driven campaigns targeting unbooked leads via WhatsApp or SMS.
      - Reopen conversations with previously qualified leads who did not convert, offering new opportunities.

    Example prompt:

    ```
    "Re-engage with leads that haven't booked a call in 30 days, offering a free consultation or product demo."
    ```
